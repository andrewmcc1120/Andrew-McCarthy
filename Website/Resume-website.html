<body id="elevatorpitch">
    I have always had a passion for technology, no matter what format. During my years as an interior painter in the custom home industry, 
    it was not uncommon for my coworkers and I to be discussing the newest and greatest trends and advancements. 
    Keeping up with those forward thinking techniques led us to be able to work on projects with some very high end clients, including Lebron James. 
    My time as an amateur rock climbing guide was also filled with future forward technologies, most importantly in the safety gear that I used, 
    and trusted, would get my clients and I safely to the objective. Now, focusing my attention to digital technologies, 
    I will bring that same curiosity, focus, long hours work ethic to whatever team I am apart of.
